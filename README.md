Machine Learning Project - kNN Algorithm Implementation
Main Tasks
This project involves the implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm for a classification problem, using the Parzen-window method. The tasks are as follows:

Implement kNN Algorithm: Implement the kNN algorithm specifically for a classification problem, based on the provided variant. The code should implement the Parzen-window method as covered in the lectures.

Dataset Exploration:

a. Tune Parameter 'k': Experiment with the 'k' parameter in the algorithm and estimate the classification quality metrics. For classification, consider Precision/Recall as the evaluation metrics. More information about these metrics can be found at this link.

b. Implement Leave-One-Out (LOO) Algorithm: Implement the Leave-one-out algorithm to find the optimal value for the hyperparameter 'k'.

c. Compare with Scikit-Learn's kNN: For the optimal 'k' value, compare your implementation with the kNN algorithm provided by Scikit-learn. The resources for Scikit-learn's version of kNN for regression and classification tasks are as follows:

i. Regression task: Visit the documentation here.

ii. Classification task: Visit the documentation here.

By following these steps, this project aims to provide a hands-on experience with implementing a common machine learning algorithm, tuning its parameters, and evaluating its performance.
